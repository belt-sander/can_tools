tesla ap reversal notes:

playing back data by priority:	

### new day new style y0 ###
0x101 == ap request stalk byte0?

0x115 == just a counter and nothing particularly special looking

0x145 == LOOKS promising?!?
	dunno maybe accel in there / YES LATERAL AND LONGITUDINAL ACCEL!
	signed byte0/1 == longitudinal accel
	signed byte2/3 == lateral accel


0x148 == mostly looks like nothing, mabye a few binary states

0x175 == looks like speed channels, maybe a high resolution incrementing counter?

0x185 == looks like maybe a brake pressure channel (yes)
	def brake pressures here, 24 bit
	unsigned byte0/1/2 == front brake?
	unsigned byte3/4/5 == rear brake?
	counter byte 6
	crc byte 7

0x206 == mostly looks like nothing

0x20a == yaw rate or some kind of lateral control maybe??
	byte 1 signed looks like yaw rate maybe, nah, probs steering angle or some derivative of that
	only pay attention to if message is generated by APE


0x26e == unintersting, non ap related

0x2b9 == something, but i dunno yet

0x309 == binary states, looks irrelevant

0x39D == something with brakes, could be brake request!!!!one11
	nah. pedal position or redudant pressure. the channel is active when AP isn't active
	unsigned byte3/2 (swap) pedal position?
	unsigned byte1 counter
	unsigned byte0 crc

0x3f8 == binary states, brake related

0x402 == dunno, looks like nothing
0x404 == dunno, looks like ticks or seconds? nothing control related
0x406 == dunno, looks like more ticks? nothing control related
0x408 == dunno, looks like nothing
0x409 == dunno
0x40A == dunno
0x418 == dunno, counter at the beginning?
0x501 == dunno, nothing really, states
0x70C == dunno, nothing really, states
