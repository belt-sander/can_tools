tesla ap reversal notes:

playing back data by priority:	

### new day new style y0 ###
0x101 == ap request stalk byte0?

0x115 == just a counter and nothing particularly special looking

0x145 == LOOKS promising?!?
	dunno maybe accel in there / YES LATERAL AND LONGITUDINAL ACCEL!
	signed byte0/1 == longitudinal accel
	signed byte2/3 == lateral accel


0x148 == mostly looks like nothing, mabye a few binary states

0x175 == looks like speed channels, maybe a high resolution incrementing counter?

0x185 == looks like maybe a brake pressure channel (yes)
	def brake pressures here, 24 bit
	unsigned byte0/1/2 == front brake?
	unsigned byte3/4/5 == rear brake?
	counter byte 6
	crc byte 7

0x206 == mostly looks like nothing

0x20a == yaw rate or some kind of lateral control maybe??
	byte 1 signed looks like yaw rate maybe, nah, probs steering angle or some derivative of that
	only pay attention to if message is generated by APE


0x26e == unintersting, non ap related

0x2b9 == something, but i dunno yet

0x309 == binary states, looks irrelevant

0x39D == something with brakes, could be brake request!!!!one11
	nah. pedal position or redudant pressure. the channel is active when AP isn't active
	unsigned byte3/2 (swap) pedal position?
	unsigned byte1 counter
	unsigned byte0 crc

0x3f8 == binary states, brake related

0x402 == dunno, looks like nothing
0x404 == dunno, looks like ticks or seconds? nothing control related
0x406 == dunno, looks like more ticks? nothing control related
0x408 == dunno, looks like nothing
0x409 == du
0x40A == dunno
0x418 == dunno, counter at the beginning?
0x501 == dunno, nothing really, states
0x70C == dunno, nothing really, states

v1 pt bus / bus 3:

0x154 == PRNDL
	byte 0 
		park = 0x12
		drive = 0x18
		neutral = 0x16
		reverse = 0x14

0x185 == iBooster channel (maybe same as chassis?)
	looks like first few bytes are position and next few are pressure??

0x238 == AP stalk
	byte 0
		normal = 0x40
		toward driver = 0x42
		away from driver = 0x41
		down = 0x60
		up = 0x50
	byte 1 
		closest distance = 0x00
		level 2 = 0x21
		level 3 = 0x42
		level 4 = 0x64
		level 5 = 0x85
		level 6 = 0xA6
		level 7 = 0xC8


difference / measurements with / without das pt and chassis connected to rest of car:

ch_bus
// passthrough, unaltered //

New message_id: 0:219 (incrementing counter on byte0 and byte2, seems static throughout AP on / AP off)
New message_id: 0:350 (all zeros, no counter, no crc)
New message_id: 0:36c (all zeros, no counter, no crc)
New message_id: 0:459 (all zeros, no counter, no crc)
New message_id: 0:5c9 (all zeros, no counter, no crc)
New message_id: 0:309 (heartbeat or something? some states in there that change when AP is active)
New message_id: 0:32b (overall unintersting states, low dynamics, no crc)
New message_id: 0:3c9 (rigid uniform counter, unwaviering)
New message_id: 0:3ca (exists on both busses (careful), no crc, probably relatively insignifigant as a result)
New message_id: 0:409 (looks like an exit state on byte0 when the vehicle is stopped, unsure, non crc, probably relatively insignfigant as a result)
New message_id: 0:531 (weird looking security type counter)
New message_id: 0:539 (more weird looking secuity type counters)

//weird af below //

New message_id: 0: 2b9 (some kind of weird bit length messages, unsure of function at this point, mabye long control. channels are active and making data even when AP is off)
New message_id: 1: 2bf (some kind of weird bit length messages, unsure of function at this point, mabye long control. channels are active and making data even when AP is off) / (8 bytes, LE order) // SAME AS 0x2b9 ON BUS 0......

// unsure what to do yet //

New message_id: 0:239 (maybe these are states or information that is directed to the cluster to show lane / car position, directly related to AP based on state in byte6, byte4 looks proportional to steering angle on straight section (880_1.csv))

// items to bit bang and figure out what they are with the m1 (remember to generate CRC) //

New message_id: 0: 389 (ap activation states, maybe chimes, instrument cluster states?)
New message_id: 1: 3bf (ap activation states, maybe chimes, instrument cluster states?) / (8 bytes, LE order) // SAME AS OX389 ON BUS 0.....

New message_id: 0: 399 (ap activation states, instrument cluster states?)
New message_id: 1: 391 (ap activation states, instrument cluster states?) / (8 bytes, LE order) // SAME AS 0X399 ON BUS 0.....

New message_id: 0: 3e9 (looks like random states on byte1 while AP is active, byte0 looks like a constant configuration, all else looks zero, crc at end)

// generate from m1 for control //
New message_id: 0:488 (lateral steering command) / (4 bytes, LE order)

no_diff_w_private can disconnected on ch_bus or pt_bus / NO ERRORS ON DISPLAY, EITHER??
